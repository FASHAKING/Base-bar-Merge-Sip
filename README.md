# Merge Sip 🍹

A beach-bar **shuffleboard merge game** built as a **Base Mini App**.

Flick tropical drinks up the sandy board. When two identical drinks collide they
merge into the next, fancier cocktail — chase the 10-tier chain all the way to
the **Legendary Tiki**. Serve to-go orders for bonus coins, and don't let the
bar back up past the dashed line!

## How to play

- **Drag** left/right to position your drink, **flick up** to slide it.
- Drinks glide on the sand with friction and bounce off the walls and each other.
- Two matching drinks that touch **merge** into the next tier (+points).
- Complete the **To-Go Order** shown at the top for a coin bonus.
- If a drink comes to rest **below the dashed line**, the bar is backed up — game over.
- Share your score straight to the feed with the **Share** button (opens the cast composer inside Base App).

## Onchain: the Drink Tally

The game has an optional onchain layer built with **wagmi + viem** following the
[Build an app on Base](https://docs.base.org/get-started/build-app) guide:

- **`contracts/src/DrinkTally.sol`** — a tiny contract on Base Sepolia: a global
  `totalServed` tally plus per-player `bestScore` / `bestTier`.
- **Wallet connection** — Base App in-app wallet (Farcaster mini app connector),
  [Base Account](https://docs.base.org/base-account/overview/what-is-base-account),
  and injected wallets (MetaMask), with auto-reconnect (`src/wallet.ts`).
- **Reads** — the global tally is shown in the HUD, your onchain best on the
  game-over screen (`readContract`, refreshed after each write).
- **Writes** — "Serve Score Onchain" on the game-over screen records your run
  (`serveScore(score, tier)`), with connect → switch-chain → sign → confirm
  states surfaced on the button.
- **EIP-5792** — wallet capabilities are detected per deployment chain
  (`getCapabilities`); smart wallets submit via atomic `sendCalls`, EOAs fall
  back to a plain `writeContract` transaction.
- The wagmi/viem bundle is **lazy-loaded** (`src/onchain.ts` facade) so the game
  paints instantly and `sdk.actions.ready()` isn't delayed.

The onchain UI stays completely hidden until you deploy the contract and
configure its address. Two ways to deploy — you need Base Sepolia ETH from a
[faucet](https://docs.base.org/base-chain/network-information/network-faucets)
either way.

**Option A — Foundry** (the [Deploy on Base](https://docs.base.org/get-started/deploy-on-base) flow):

```bash
cd contracts
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash && foundryup   # install Foundry once
cp .env.example .env && source .env
cast wallet import deployer --interactive                  # never commit keys

# dry run first, then add --broadcast to actually deploy:
forge create ./src/DrinkTally.sol:DrinkTally \
  --rpc-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --account deployer --broadcast

# verify:
cast call <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "totalServed()(uint256)" --rpc-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

**Option B — Node only** (no Foundry needed; uses solc + viem):

```bash
npm i -D solc
node scripts/compile-contract.mjs
PRIVATE_KEY=0x... node scripts/deploy.mjs --network base-sepolia
```

Then paste the deployed address into `DEPLOYED_ADDRESS` in
`src/config/tally.ts` and rebuild. (For a quick test without editing code:
`localStorage.setItem('merge-sip-tally-address', '0x...')` and reload.)

**Local end-to-end loop** (no testnet ETH needed) — deploy to a local chain and
play against it:

```bash
npm i -D solc ganache playwright
npx ganache --chain.chainId 84532 --wallet.deterministic   # terminal 1
node scripts/compile-contract.mjs                          # terminal 2
PRIVATE_KEY=<a ganache key> node scripts/deploy.mjs --network local
npm run dev                                                # terminal 3
node scripts/e2e-local-chain.mjs <deployed-address>        # full flow test
```

The E2E script drives the real game UI against the local chain: reads the
tally, connects, saves a score (`serveScore`), waits for the receipt, and
verifies the reads refresh.

For **mainnet**: deploy the contract to Base, set `TALLY_CHAIN` to `base` in
`src/config/tally.ts`, and update the address. The Base App in-app wallet lives
on Base mainnet, so do this before publishing.

## Tech

- [Vite](https://vite.dev) + TypeScript, zero-framework
- Canvas 2D rendering with a small custom physics engine (circle collisions, sand friction, flick input)
- All art is drawn procedurally at runtime (`src/drinks.ts`) — no image assets needed in-game
- WebAudio synth for sound effects (`src/sfx.ts`) — no audio assets
- [`@farcaster/miniapp-sdk`](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz) for Base App integration
  (`sdk.actions.ready()`, `composeCast` score sharing, haptics), with graceful
  fallbacks so the game also runs in any plain browser
- `@wagmi/core` + `viem` for the onchain layer (no React — the game is plain
  canvas, so the guide's hooks map to core actions: `useReadContract` →
  `readContract`, `useSendCalls` → `sendCalls`, `useCapabilities` →
  `getCapabilities`, and so on)

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:5173
npm run build   # outputs dist/
```

## Deploy as a Base Mini App

1. **Deploy the static site** (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, …).
   Build command `npm run build`, output directory `dist`. Note your production
   URL, e.g. `https://merge-sip.vercel.app`.

2. **Point the app at your URL.** Replace every occurrence of
   `https://merge-sip.example.com` with your production URL in:
   - `public/.well-known/farcaster.json` (homeUrl, iconUrl, splashImageUrl, heroImageUrl, ogImageUrl)
   - `index.html` (the `fc:miniapp` / `fc:frame` meta tags)
   - `src/base.ts` (`APP_URL`)

   Then rebuild and redeploy.

3. **Verify ownership (account association).** Generate the signed
   `accountAssociation` for your domain and paste it into
   `public/.well-known/farcaster.json`:
   - Easiest: [Base Build](https://base.dev) → your app → *Manifest* tool, or
   - Farcaster developer tools → *Domains* → sign the manifest with your Farcaster custody account.

4. **Link your Base Build account.** Put your Base Build account address in
   `baseBuilder.allowedAddresses` in `public/.well-known/farcaster.json`.

5. **Preview & publish.** Check the manifest is served at
   `https://<your-domain>/.well-known/farcaster.json`, then preview the app with
   the Base Build preview tool and share the URL in Base App — the `fc:miniapp`
   embed makes it render as a launchable card.

## Repo tooling

- `scripts/gen-assets.mjs` + `assetgen.html` — regenerate `public/icon.png`,
  `public/splash.png`, `public/hero.png` by rendering the in-game art in
  headless Chromium (`npm i -D playwright`, run `npm run dev`, then
  `node scripts/gen-assets.mjs`).
- `scripts/smoke-test.mjs` — headless gameplay smoke test (launch, merge,
  game over, restart) against the dev server.
- `scripts/onchain-test.mjs` — headless test of the onchain flow using a mock
  EIP-1193 provider (connect, capability detection, EOA write path).
